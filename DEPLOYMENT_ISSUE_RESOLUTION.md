# üö® DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLUTION - CRITICAL FINDINGS

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

You were absolutely correct to be suspicious! We discovered a **critical deployment issue**:

### **‚ùå THE PROBLEM:**
- **Two different repositories** were being used:
  - `origin` ‚Üí `https://github.com/Riko5652/geneva-guide-main.git` (where we were pushing)

### **‚úÖ THE SOLUTION:**
- **Synchronized both repositories** with the latest changes
- **Pushed to the correct Netlify repository** (`netlify-repo`)
- **Fixed all deployment and caching issues**

## üõ†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**
